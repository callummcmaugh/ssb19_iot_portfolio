# Introduction
Hello! 
My name is Callum McMaugh and I am a 22 year old 5th year undergrad studying Engineering at the University of Technology, Sydney, majoring in Mechatronics. You killed my father. Prepare to Die.
### Why I enrolled in Summer Studio B
#### Motivation
I enrolled in summer studio B because I want to expand on my learning through the summer period and the subjects
on offer were interesting to me, specifically the IoT Development course. I was enrolled in Summer Studio A in 2018
and I anjoyed the course then, so I took an extra interest to seek information about this years offerings. 

In my future as a robotics engineer, live data communication over networks is something of great interest when thinking about deployed products. I work a lot in software
right now and being able to track users data wherever they are the get live feedback of your service is great, and to apply this to robotics is essentially IoT. If I'm ever
going to need to monitor multiple rebots, wired or wireless, the foundation of this is IoT development.

#### Objective
I hope that Summer Studio B will be able to help me: 
1. Identify problems and develop solutions to those problems. 
2. Learn about how to solve real work problems. 
3. Making custom designs and solutions. 
4. Expand on my teamwork skills. 
5. Overall I'd like to improve myself, being better than when I started by being critical on my development.

I'd really like to learn a lot about IoT and the architecture around it, theres a lot of things invovled and by being able to grasp an undertsaning of that,
I believe i'd imporve my skills as an engineer. There are many applications I see in the world currently with IoT, and with an interested in Robotics, being able to
use IoT devices for automation and connection between multiple 'things' then I can see some applications that would useful in Robotics.

## Learning Contract

### Learning Objectives
#### Goals
My goals for Summer Studio B are:
* Build an IoT Device that communicates with a server.
* Learn about and design some 3D printed models.
* Understand how the IoT architecture works.
* Develop an IoT application and 3D housing for a product.

#### Tasks
To achieve these goals, the tasks I need to do are:
* Learn about IoT and the architecture around them.
* Design a container for a product using 3D Printing.
* Produce a solution to a problem.

### Group
My contribution to the group will be done by attending class and talking with team members, as well
as developing the circuitry and logic on how to interect with the circuit on the software side. I will
also help in the design for the 3D printed housing.
I will use Microsoft Teams to share information and collaborate with other people in my class remotely.

### What will I learn
Hopefully I will learn a lot about IoT and how they work, being able to build them, but also understand everything
about them. Along with this is learning about 3D printing methods so I can know how to design and manufacture custom
designs easily.

### What will I produce
I aim to produce an IoT solution that solves a real world problem that I know inside and out how it works. I also hope
to produce better results in myself in regards to my objectives for this subject, such as improving my team working skills,
or personally developing, or even improving my problem solving skills. I will assess this by being able to produce an IoT solution
to a real world problem while working in a team where we are critical of eachother and ourselves.

### Resources & Strategies
My stategies are:
* Design a well thought out 3D design for my project
* Focus on my team and tackle problems head on
* Read about the technologies we're going to use and how to implement them
#### Resources
* [Draw.io](https://www.draw.io/) - Used to draw circuit designs
* [Soil Sensor](http://www.circuitstoday.com/arduino-soil-moisture-sensor) - Information on soil sensors and setup
