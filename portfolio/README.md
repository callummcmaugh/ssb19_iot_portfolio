Hello! 
My name is Callum McMaugh and I am a 22 year old 5th year undergrad studying Engineering at the University of Technology, Sydney, majoring in Mechatronics.

# Why did I enrolled in Summer Studio B 2019?
## Motivation
I enrolled in summer studio B because I want to expand on my learning through the summer period and the subjects
on offer were interesting to me, specifically the IoT Development course. I was enrolled in Summer Studio A in 2018
and I anjoyed the course then, so I took an extra interest to seek information about this years offerings. 

In my future as a robotics engineer, live data communication over networks is something of great interest when thinking about deployed products. I work a lot in software
right now and being able to track users data wherever they are the get live feedback of your service is great, and to apply this to robotics is essentially IoT. If I'm ever
going to need to monitor multiple rebots, wired or wireless, the foundation of this is IoT development.

## Objective
I hope that Summer Studio B will be able to help me: 
1. Identify problems and develop solutions to those problems. 
2. Learn about how to solve real work problems. 
3. Making custom designs and solutions. 
4. Expand on my teamwork skills. 
5. Overall I'd like to improve myself, being better than when I started by being critical on my development.

I'd really like to learn a lot about IoT and the architecture around it, theres a lot of things invovled and by being able to grasp an undertsaning of that,
I believe i'd imporve my skills as an engineer. There are many applications I see in the world currently with IoT, and with an interested in Robotics, being able to
use IoT devices for automation and connection between multiple 'things' then I can see some applications that would useful in Robotics.

# My Project
For this course we are required to define our own project and application for what we learn. Something that has always been interesting to me is the idea of being able to
track plant maintainence properties in an easy to use way, such as not having to power several different planters and link them all together. This is explore deeper in my
sprint blog entries.

## Learning Objectives
### Goals
My goals for Summer Studio B are listed below with a few objectives to aid me in achieving them:
1. Build an IoT Device in the cloud:
  * Create a device that uses a WiFi chip to sends off sensors data to a broker and can receive messages.
  * Develop a message broker to handle the data using Node.js that will then store the data
  * Program a backend on the cloud to store the data in a database so it can be easily accessed by all users and devices
  * Create a dashboard to display this data from an API that interacts with a database for users to see how their sensors are performing
  * Setup a backend API for the client dashboard to interact with the database to show and graph the data from sensors.
  * Develop parts of the architecture with my team so that we have an understanding of the data flow in the project
  * Get help from teammates who develop different parts of the architecture so the work isnt repeated or falls onto one individual
  * Use services that are able to do a lot of the work for the backend, such as AWS, Vulture, MQTT Brokers, MongoDB and some more.
  * Develop an API for the dashboard for all the students in my group to see their data live as its trasnmitted from our devices.
  * Create various middleware between each service in the architecture so they can safely communicate with eachother.

2. Learn about and design 3D printed models:
  * Define the contraints of my system to design around such as the size and weight etc.
  * A modular design for all my 3D prints so they can be connected togther for a robust design and to deduce the level of electircal maintainence
  * How to model an object for 3D printing from Solidworks or other modelling software
  * Going through the manufacturing process of the prints and iterating on them.
  * Consider the components used to derive a design that makes the components fit well with a 3D design from a flush finish.
  

## Group Contributions
My contribution to the group will be done by attending class and talking with team members, as well
as developing the circuitry and logic on how to interect with the circuit on the software side. I will
also help in the design for the 3D printed housing.

I will also be working in teams of 5 to share code snippets across projects, so If someone developers a node server
then the others in the group can ask for this code for quicker development. We're all working on our own projects but
collborate on the same technologies so we can all move along quicker.

I will use Microsoft Teams to share information and collaborate with other people in my class remotely.

## What I want to learn
Hopefully I will learn a lot about IoT and how they work, being able to build them, but also understand everything
about them. Along with this is learning about 3D printing methods so I can know how to design and manufacture custom
designs easily.
Overall, I simple want to learn how to make a finish IoT service with some 3D printing to house my device. This doesn't need to be too complicated,
but getting to a point where I can continue to explore IoT after the course would be great. I want to leave this course at least understanding how to
set up my own IoT.

## What I aim to produce
I aim to produce an IoT solution that solves a real world problem that I know inside and out how it works. I also hope
to produce better results in myself in regards to my objectives for this subject, such as improving my team working skills,
or personally developing, or even improving my problem solving skills. I will assess this by being able to produce an IoT solution
to a real world problem while working in a team where we are critical of eachother and ourselves.

## Resources & Strategies
### Strategies
* To handle the IoT side, I will use a lot of online resources to find answers to my problems
* Danon, our tutor, is able to provide help with debugging and will also help in solving problems
* Learn about cloud architecture to handle the data flow of the IoT from online resources
* Use a vareity of available back end services to handle the data flow
* Allow my work to be used by other members in my team so we can all speed up our development flow
* 3D printing skills from Solidworks will be used to design the model, with libraries to handle converting to a layered object for printing
* To make the components and housing fit well, I will have to find the dimensions of all my components when doing the design.
